# ComputerVision-DeepLearning


Here I am implementing everything I learned about OpenCV. I did this implementations while following the courses on [PyimageSearch]('https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/10/06/opencv-contour-approximation/')


The OpenCV notebook contains the basics of OpenCV such as Loading an Image, Resizing Images, Rotating Image, Edge Detection, Thresholding, Drawing and Masking, Contour   and Shape Detection.

The OCV Project notebook contains the implementation of Color Detection and Histogram Matching on images.
